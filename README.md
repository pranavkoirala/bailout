i got tired of going to plans i did NOT want to.

bailout was made because i had been going out a lot
and ended up going to many outings that i just did not 
want to attend, and neither did the other people part of the
group. 

bailout works this way:
create a plan and schedule a date on it. invite the people with the link
and you can password protect the link if needed.

each person can log in and select themselves, and then cancel the plan on their end.
it will not notify anyone else until EVERYBODY has pressed the "cancel plan" button.

this was my solution for my group of friends ending up with plans that half if not everybody
did not want to end up going to.

currently offline because winter break but will be back up after.
